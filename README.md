## Problem: Sum Square Difference

- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
- The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
- Hence the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares is 3025 − 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Instructions
- Code your procedural solution into the `lib/sum_square_difference.rb` file.
- Code your object-oriented solution into the `lib/oo_sum_square_difference.rb` file.
- Run your `rspec` test suite, and make each RSpec test pass.
